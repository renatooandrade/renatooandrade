## Hello ğŸ‘‹

My name is Renato, I'm 27 years old and I have a degree in Civil Engineering (2018). I'm studying programming with the "FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT" class.

I started my studies in the Development area in 2021 and I was able to experience some technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Jquery, React, Firebase, Node, among others.

I will share some of my projects here on Github, projects that are part of my learning process.
